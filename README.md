:boom: Hello; I'm NakoTurk. I'm from Turkey. I've been interested in testnets for a long time. And I participated in many tests.  I am the first person to open a channel in the Testnet category on Youtube Turkey. Through this, I have helped many people to enter and learn in this sector. I also continue to be and teach by posting videos, guides. I am the founder and manager of Celestia and Subspace Network projects Telegram channels in Turkey. Along with the Discord of these two projects, I am also moderating the Discord of the Dymension project and am an Ambassador at Subspace Network. I took part in mainnet and testnets with both node setups. I joined the test network of 250+ projects and ran 500+ nodes. In addition to my experience in testnets.
